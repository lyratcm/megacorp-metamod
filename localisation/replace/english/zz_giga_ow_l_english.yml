This field first grows to surround Sirenalia, then Faust, and eventually, the entire system.\n\nIt takes mere hours for the field to engulf all of Faust's planetary neighborhood, with anything in its vicinity, whether it be ships, planets, or floating debris, being inevitably absorbed by the field.\n\nAfter roughly a day, the field, now dubbed the §YEthereal Shroud§! settles, disrupting all hyperlanes as well as rendering other forms of FTL travel outright impossible. Ships and transmissions sent to investigate the system simply disappear from existence, never to be seen again. The conclusion is clear: for the time being, the Faust system has essentially been removed from the galaxy, evidently as a result of the Sirens' plans.\n\nWhile it is uncertain if this strange shroud will ever dissipate, slight variances in its energy signatures seem to indicate that it might eventually disappear after roughly §Y//[this.eawaf_year]§! has passed, although whether this turns out to be accurate or merely guesswork remains to be seen."
